# Bitmap Creation
I've created this to allow pupils to create and design 1 and 2bit colour depth bitmap images using a web browser, whose binary data representation is then shown on screen.

I will be using it with mainly KS3 pupils, but there's no reason why it can be used for KS4 and up if they'd like to build their own.

I've tested it on the latest Google Chrome on MacOS and Windows, but should be ok for other variations.  The CSS and JS is all inline, to maake it easier to publish on VLEs such as Google Classroom and Microsoft Teams.

Alternatively, you can use the followiung URLs hosted on CloudFlare Pages:
* [1-Bit / 8 x 8 Grid, 2 Colours](https://bitmap-creation.pages.dev/binary-with-images.htm)
* [2-Bit / 16 x 16 Grid, 4 Colours](https://bitmap-creation.pages.dev/binary-with-images-2bit.htm)
